# Travel Planning App - Functional Specification

## Project Overview

A travel planning web application focused on trip management with integrated weather checking functionality. Built as a demo project for AI-assisted development workshop using TypeScript, React Router v7, and modern web technologies.

## Core Features

### 1. Trip Management

**Primary Feature - Core Functionality**

#### User Stories

- As a user, I want to create new trips with basic details (name, destination, dates)
- As a user, I want to edit existing trip information
- As a user, I want to delete trips I no longer need
- As a user, I want to view all my trips in a single dashboard

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Trip creation form with validation for required fields
- Trip list display showing all user trips
- Edit functionality accessible from trip display
- Delete confirmation to prevent accidental removal
- Persist trip data locally between sessions

### 2. Weather Integration

**Secondary Feature - Value Add**

#### User Stories

- As a user, I want to see current weather for my trip destination
- As a user, I want to view weather forecast for my travel dates
- As a user, I want weather information to update automatically when I change trip details

#### Acceptance Criteria

- Weather display integrated into trip dashboard
- Real-time weather data fetching based on destination
- Weather forecast for trip date range
- Graceful handling of weather API failures
- Clear indication of weather data loading states

## User Interface Requirements

### Single-Page Dashboard Design

- All functionality accessible from main dashboard
- Trip cards displaying essential information
- Integrated weather widgets within trip displays
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Clean, intuitive navigation

### Key UI Components

- Trip creation/edit form
- Trip card component with weather integration
- Weather display widget
- Loading states and error handling
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## Data Requirements

### Trip Entity

```typescript
interface Trip {
  id: string
  name: string
  destination: string
  startDate: Date
  endDate: Date
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### Weather Data

```typescript
interface WeatherData {
  location: string
  current: CurrentWeather
  forecast: WeatherForecast[]
  lastUpdated: Date
}
```

## Technical Constraints

### Performance Requirements

- Page load time under 3 seconds
- Weather data refresh within 5 seconds
- Smooth user interactions without blocking

### Data Persistence

- Local data storage with file persistence
- Data survival across browser sessions
- Simple backup/restore capability

## Success Criteria

### MVP Definition

- Create, read, update, delete trips
- Display current weather for trip destinations
- Single-page dashboard interface
- Data persistence between sessions

### Demo Requirements

- Working demonstration of core features
- Clear user workflow from trip creation to weather viewing
- Robust error handling with user-friendly messages
- Professional UI suitable for presentation

## Future Considerations

_(Out of scope for initial demo)_

- User authentication and multi-user support
- Itinerary planning features
- Packing list management
- Budget tracking
- Flight booking integration
- Mobile app version
